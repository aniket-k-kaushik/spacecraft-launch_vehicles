## Step 1 - Spacecraft and launch vehicles

1. Design a database structure for storing details of launch vehicles and spacecraft, where each launch vehicle can launch multiple spacecraft
2. Implement associations in the model to easily find:
    1. Which launch vehicle launched a given spacecraft
    2. The list of spacecraft launched by a launch vehicle
3. Implement a CRUD API for launch vehicles and spacecraft
